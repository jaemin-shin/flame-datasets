# Flame Datasets

>The repo is part of the project Flame at Cisco Systems, containing datasets required to run its examples.

For MedMNIST dataset, we split PathMNIST from [MedMNIST](https://medmnist.com/) into 10 folds in a non-i.i.d fashion as [FedMA paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06440) did for federated learning on a data heterogeneous setting.

For UCI-HAR dataset, we use data collected from 30 users for federated learning, where 21 users are used for training and 9 users are used for testing as in [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones) reference.
